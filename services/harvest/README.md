# Tracking notes in Harvest

Every day at work we use Geekbot to send an automatic message for daily standups. Although I am not intentially skipping
these standups, I tend to forget them fairly often. This micro project is geared towards fixing that by automatically 
gathering notes to add to the "What I did today" section
